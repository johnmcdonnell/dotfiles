My dotfiles
===========

These are intended to be installed as a [Homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) castle.


Setup
-----
This config expects to find `redshift_username` and `redshift_password` defined in a `.passwords` file, like so:

    export redshift_username=my_username
    export redshift_password=my_password
